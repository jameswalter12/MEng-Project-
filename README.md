## File 1 - OBJECT DETECTION TEST 

So this file is a preliminary attempt at some object detection using quite simple openCV packages, the code is hardly original with the majority of code being taken from source 1 (see below). Any image can be chosen for the code but it was designed with a simple photo of an iphone and works to some extent. However, as mentioned the code is not optimised at all for the photos and was more or less copied from the source (1).
