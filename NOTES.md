# Notes

- [ ] January 14th 2026 - So there is a line of code in Shehan's main fail that directs the script to PRUSA slicer files that are downloaded within the src folder, however the code agent in VSCODE has clocked that these should be updated to be MacOS files, ensure this is changed

- [ ] So I need to look into what the serial ports are, there is functionality in the code that should let you connect to the 3D printer by the serial? Not sure how this works, if I have to do anything with the printer/code, if anything has to be initialised or sorted out - can I just put my laptop next to the printer?? Does anything have to actually be done here??
